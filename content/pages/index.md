    title: ' Bitcoin '
    subtitle: >-
      Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or
      single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the
      peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.
      Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and
      recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain

      - title: Why Bitcoin
        content: "Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network.\_**Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and\_**[**everyone can take part**](https://bitcoin.org/en/support-bitcoin). Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.\n"

      - title: Why bank and government dont want this kind of currency ?
        content: "*Those who see governments banning ownership of bitcoin are ignoring the political power and influence of those who are snapping up most of the bitcoin.*\n\nTo really understand an asset, we have to examine not just the asset itself but\_*who owns it, and who can afford to own it*.\_These attributes will illuminate the\_*political and financial power wielded by the owners of the asset class*.\n\nAnd once we know what sort of political/financial power is in the hands of those owning the asset class, we can predict the limits of political restrictions that can be imposed on that ownership.\n\nAnd I am amused that when essayists claim “the government” will do whatever benefits the government most. While this is broadly true, this ignores the reality that\_*wealthy individuals and corporations own the processes of governance*.\n\nMore accurately, we can say that\_government will do whatever benefits those who control the levers of power most, which is quite different than claiming that the government acts solely to further its own interests. More specifically, it furthers what those at the top of the wealth-power pyramid have set as the government’s interests.\n\n"

        content: >
          Being a type of money independent from banks, corporations, and
          states, the management costs for each transaction are minimal. In this
          way, people can buy and sell without asking permission from any bank
          or third party.
